# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity - Time taken by our code to solve particular problem.

Space Complexity - Space taken by our code to solve particulat problem.

## Time Complexity ##

1) Omega Notation Ω (Best case)
2) Theta Notation θ (Average case)
3) Big O Notation O (Worst case)

We also consider worst case for calculating our time complexity.
