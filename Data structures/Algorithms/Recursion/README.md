### Components of Recursion ###
1) Base condition - This condition is responsible for termination of recursive calls.
2) Logic - Sort of code to solve our problem.
3) Recursive calls - Functions calling itself

### Understanding recursion using basic maths ###

f(x) is function which will calculate square of any given number.
f(x) = x*x; 

x=2; f(2)= 2*2 = 4

x=f(2); f(x)=f(f(2))=f(4)=4*4=16


### Recursion Application ###
1. Sorting
2. Trees
3. Graphs
